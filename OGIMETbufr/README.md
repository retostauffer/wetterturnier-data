Why This Script
===============

We (Reto) have had no chance to get some of the additional BUFR
files from DWD or somewhere else. However, OGIMET allows to
download them.

This small script downloads the MeteoSwiss BUFR files and
copies them into the incoming additional folder. The parsing/decoding
is then performed by the GISCobservations/bufr.py script.


* `bash get_latest.sh`

... should work.
