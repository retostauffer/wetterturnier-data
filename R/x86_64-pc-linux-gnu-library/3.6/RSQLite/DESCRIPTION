Description: Embeds the SQLite database engine in R and
    provides an interface compliant with the DBI package. The source for
    the SQLite engine and for various extensions in a recent version is
    included. System libraries will never be consulted because
    this package relies on static linking for the plugins it includes;
    this also ensures a consistent experience across all installations.
